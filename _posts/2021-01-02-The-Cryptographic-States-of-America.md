**I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night when I finally get to present my project findings to my part-time Data Science Cohort. I looked at the distribution of freestanding, cash-only Bitcoin ATMs located in the U.S. Here is a [link](https://medium.com/@Cryptobellum/the-cryptographic-states-of-america-ebe94659cb6) to the corresponding blog post for this project.

I also shared it on [Twitter].(https://twitter.com/Cryptobellum/status/1346933936455299073?s=20)
